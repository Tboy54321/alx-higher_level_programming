Introduction to SQL Project
Welcome to the "Introduction to SQL" project! In this project, we will explore the fundamentals of SQL (Structured Query Language) and its application in managing and querying relational databases. SQL is a powerful tool used to interact with and manipulate data stored in databases, making it an essential skill for anyone working with data or pursuing a career in data analysis, database management, or software development.

Project Overview
In this project, we will cover the following key areas:

Database Setup: Learn how to set up a local database using popular database management systems such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite.

Data Modeling: Understand the basics of data modeling, including defining tables, specifying data types, primary keys, and foreign keys.

Data Manipulation Language (DML): Dive into SQL's DML capabilities, including inserting, updating, and deleting data within the database tables.

Data Querying: Explore the core aspect of SQL - querying data. Learn to retrieve specific information using the SELECT statement, filtering, sorting, and using various operators.

Data Aggregation: Discover how to aggregate and summarize data using functions like COUNT, SUM, AVG, MIN, and MAX.

Joins and Relationships: Master the art of combining data from multiple tables using various types of joins (INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL) to gain insights from related data.

Subqueries: Learn to create subqueries, a powerful tool for breaking down complex problems into manageable parts, allowing you to retrieve and manipulate data more effectively.

Data Modification Language (DML): Dive deeper into DML operations, including advanced UPDATE and DELETE statements with conditions and joins.

Indexing and Performance: Understand the importance of indexing for database performance, and learn how to create and manage indexes effectively.

Data Integrity: Explore the concepts of constraints, transactions, and ACID properties to ensure the reliability and consistency of your database.

Project Structure
The project is divided into several sections, each focusing on a specific aspect of SQL. Each section contains:

Conceptual Explanation: A brief overview of the topic with relevant explanations and examples.
Hands-On Exercises: Practical exercises to reinforce your understanding and provide hands-on experience.
Challenge Problems: Extra challenges to push your skills further and encourage creative problem-solving.
